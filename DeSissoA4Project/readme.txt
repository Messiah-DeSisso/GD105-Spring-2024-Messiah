Program 1

The program I created illuminates a visual representation of song lyrics by Lil Herb, aka G Herbo, from the track "Fight or Flight." I believe this section of lyrics can be synonymous with peotry due to the deep message.Each word from the section of lyrics is displayed over the individual boxes on the screen. My program arranges these boxes into neat columns and rows, making sure they all fit within the canvas size. Additionally, Users can drag words from the "word bank" into the boxes almost like a word search. I used class objects and the draw function mainly to achieve this!


Program 2

My second program visualizes the career points per game (PPG) of Kawhi Leonard throughout his different seasons and teams.I tried to creatively show this through a graph. The grpah loads data from a CSV file I made containing information about Kawhi's PPG, team names, and seasons. The graph represents Kawhi's PPG over time, with bars representing each season's performance and the team that he was on.Additionally, It includes functionality for users to hover over the bars to see detailed information about each season, such as the team he was on the PPG of that season. I created another class here and used the hover effect function in order to acheive this look!
