Project: Messiah's Radio!

Description:
I created a simple radio player program that plays multiple songs! The program has a simple user interface that I created through multiple photoshopped images. My radio allows users to play, pause, and skip songs.

Features:

Play multiple songs
Display song title
Pause and skip songs
Automatic playback mode

Usage:

Use the mouse to click on the radio buttons to play, pause, and skip songs.
Use the 'space' key to toggle auto mode on and off.
Use the 's' key to stop the current song.
Use the 'n' key to skip to the next song.
