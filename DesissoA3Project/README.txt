A3R3 - The Moire Pattern Remake
This program generates an beautiful visual pattern of rotating lines that resembles the Moire pattern. As the lines rotate, their colors also change, creating a cool effect. 

Features:
Dynamic Rotation: The lines rotate continuously, creating a captivating visual effect.
Variable Speed: The speed of rotation can be adjusted by modifying the angleSpeed variable. Increasing this value speeds up the rotation, altering the pattern dynamically.
Color Mapping: The color of each line is mapped based on its position, creating a gradient effect as the lines rotate.
Customizable Parameters: Instead of hardcoding values, I can modify the number of lines (numLines) and their parameters such as angle speed (lineSpeeds) and offsets (lineOffsets), which makes for a wider range of visual patterns.
