DeSisso A2 Project Readme File

A2R1 - I created a collage of the top things I like/ the things I think embody who I am the most! I added photos that I edited in a collage fashion where some photos overlap others. Additionally, I added that on click that the background
color change from black to white. I could not decide on which color looked better, So I decided to add both.

A2R2 - In my program, I created a "Purple Rain" simulation! I added a image that I made on photoshop to act as the main logo and created a simulation with 100 purple raindrops, when these raindrops reach the botton, they reset again until the whole screen is filled with 100 raindrops!

A2R3 - For my third program, I made a replica "Etch a Sketch" board. I created the red background with the black screen space along with the logo that is up top. When your mouse reaches the black drawable area, it creates random color circles that follow where your mouse goes! Instead of being able to draw everywhere, I constrained the drawing to a 600x600 black "screen" space so you cannot draw outside those confines.

A2R4 - My last program creates a simple GIF of a basketball bouncing in front of a rim. As the basketball bounces, I had it lose "velocity" so that after a few bounces it loses it's momentum and gets completey still.
